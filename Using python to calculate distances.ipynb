    "Transporters are membrane-embedded proteins that translocate a wide range of substrates - ions, small molecules, big molecules - across the membrane. Primary active transporters utilize energy in the form of ATP to achieve this process, whereas secondary active transporters rely on the electrochemical gradient of one substrate to power the movement of the other. Regardless of the source of energy, all transporters need to undergo certain conformational motions to bind, translocate and release their substrates. It has been proposed \n",
